            Appeal to repair the Central Ridge Forest wall and resolve the waste dumping issue
          </u>
        </p>
        <p>
            This email is in reference to large-scale garbage dumping inside the Central Ridge Forest, primarily due to a 
            broken wall section. There has been rampant dumping of non-biodegradable waste, including plastic, fabric, glass,
            metal, discarded household waste and so forth, which has been causing disruption of the forest cover for many years.
            There are cases of open defecation in the forest area including discarded diapers. A break in the forest wall 
            provides easy access inside the forest, slowly turning it into a massive dumping ground. No action has been taken
            despite the constant efforts in cleanups, complaints letters, and follow-up letters.
        </p>
        <p>
            The damaged wall and dump's location is https://goo.gl/maps/8854D45n6LCVuqrW6, i.e., Pusa Rd, WEA, Rajinder Nagar, New Delhi, Delhi 110005. The coordinates are 28°38'39.7"N 77°11'30.4"E. The damaged wall is situated on the roadside between metro pillars 91 and 92. The landmark is Ganga Ram Hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
            There have been six complaints, including follow-up letters, yet no action has been taken. The dump keeps accumulating and aggravating the issues and causing pollution. There Is No Earth B has been conducting cleanups in Ridge Forest since 2019 and at the location of the damaged wall since 4 January 2020. The cleanups conducted between 26 February 2022 and 9 July 2022 have observed the participation of 161 volunteers (not unique) and the volunteers have collectively removed <b>1 ton and 483.5 Kgs of waste</b> from the above location. The rest of the Central Ridge Forest area is also plagued by littering and as a result There Is No Earth B has curated cleanups in other forest areas as well. 56 volunteers removed 874 Kg of waste from the location of the damaged wall, which is reported in the Hindustan Times. 
            https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/volunteer-groups-remove-874kg-of-garbage-from-central-ridge-in-delhi-101646245691225-amp.html 
            
        </p>
        <p>
            The waste keeps accumulating even after recurring cleanups causing a foul smell and potentially releasing harmful gases. Even though There Is No Earth B has complained about this pressing issue, the wall remains damaged, observing an inlet of immense waste inside the forest. There Is No Earth B has written seven letters to the concerned authorities and personally submitted the follow-up complaint letter dated 22 April 2022 (PFA) at the Central Pollution Control Board office. However, all the efforts are in vain, and the issue persists. We are forced to file an email petition after two years of painstaking efforts. We have requested several times but now our patience is at brink as we have been pleading with the concerned authorities for two years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, as concerned citizens, we plead with the concerned authorities and call for immediate action from the authorities against dumping and burning of waste, open defecation and logging in the forest area. We would also like to request the Forest Department, the Ridge Management Board and other concerned officials to examine the Central Ridge Forest area and take corrective measures as soon as possible.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Thanking You <br />
            Yours sincerely,
        </p>
